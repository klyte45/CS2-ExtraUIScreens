# Extra UI Screens Mod
## Use additional monitors

This mod is designed to allow use any screen available in current PC to show other mods information. It also allows creating a new overlay over the game screen, both integrated with game and as a new separated layer (as it was an extra screen).

Modders can take advantage from this mod to create complexes UI, like report tables, map drawings or advanced mod setups. 

This mod is just a platform for other mods, it does almost nothing in the game alone.

## For mod creators

Check the base react project at my [GitHub](https://github.com/klyte45/EUIS-baseproj-fe) to get instructions about how to create a new frontend application into EUIS.

Soon will be available a base project for creating mods windows over the vanilla UI keeping the interactivity with vanilla UI.

Also there will have a way to add simple buttons to toggle tools in the vanilla UI in a dock group - like Unified UI (UUI) used to do in CS1. The mod window over vanilla UI explained above also will generate a button there.

Detailed tutorials soon!
